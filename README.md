Markdown blog tutorial from youtube  
use npm to install:  
`slugify nodemon mongoose method-override marked jsdom express ejs dompurify`  
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM&list=LL&index=1&t=116s`  
This was very fun. Next step is to learn how to slap authenticatiom and authorization on it so that I can use  
the edit and delete buttons, but nobody else can.  
I would also like to change the index page to have links to categories, and some type of search function that  
searches the description or something like that.
