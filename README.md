Markdown blog tutorial from youtube  
use npm to install:  
`slugify  mongoose method-override marked jsdom express ejs dompurify`

This was very fun. Next step is to learn how to slap authenticatiom and authorization on it so that I can use  
the edit and delete buttons, but nobody else can.  
I would also like to change the index page to have links to categories, and some type of search function that  
searches the description or something like that.
